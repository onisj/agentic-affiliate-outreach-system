# Agentic Affiliate Outreach System Design

## Overview

The Agentic Affiliate Outreach System is an autonomous platform for discovering, engaging, and managing affiliate prospects. It supports multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn, Twitter), personalized messaging, response tracking, and GDPR-compliant data management.

## Architecture

* **Backend:** FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL
* **Frontend:** Gradio for admin dashboard
* **Integrations:** SendGrid, Twitter API, LinkedIn API
* **Deployment:** Docker, docker-compose

## Components

1. **Lead Generation Module** (`services/lead_discovery.py`):

- Discovers prospects via Twitter and LinkedIn APIs.
- Stores prospects with `consent_given=False` until opt-in.


2. Lead Qualification Engine (`services/scoring_service.py`):

- Scores prospects based on email domain, website quality, and social presence.
- Updates status to "qualified" for scores ≥70.


3. **Communication Manager** (`tasks/outreach_tasks.py`):

- Sends personalized messages via email, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
- Enforces consent and rate limits.


4. **Response Handler** (`tasks/response_handler.py`):

- Uses TextBlob for sentiment analysis of replies.
- Triggers follow-ups based on sentiment.


5. **Data Management System** (`database/models.py`):

- Stores prospects, templates, campaigns, and message logs.
- Supports GDPR with consent tracking and soft deletes.


6. **Analytics/Reporting** (`ui/gradio_app.py`):

- Displays KPIs (e.g., response rate, conversion rate).
- Logs activities for auditing.



## Data Flow

1. Prospects discovered via APIs → Stored in `affiliate_prospects`.
2. Scored by `score_prospect` task → Updated in database.
3. Campaigns created → Messages sent via `send_outreach_message`.
4. Responses processed by `handle_prospect_response` → Follow-ups sent.
5. Analytics displayed in Gradio UI.

## Compliance

- **GDPR:** Consent verification, unsubscribe links, data encryption.
- **Platform Policies:** Rate-limiting for Twitter/LinkedIn APIs.
- **Auditing:** Message logs track all interactions.

## Scalability

- **Redis/Celery:** Handles asynchronous tasks.
- **PostgreSQL:** Indexes on email and status for performance.
- **Docker:** Auto-scaling with docker-compose.

## Security

- **JWT:** Secures API endpoints.
- **Encryption:** Database and API communications use TLS.
- **Consent:** Enforced before outreach.

## Future Improvements

- Add ML-based prospect prioritization.
- Support additional channels (e.g., Instagram).
- Implement A/B testing for outreach messages.
