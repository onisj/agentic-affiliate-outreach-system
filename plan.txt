CREATE TABLE affiliate_prospects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    company VARCHAR(255),
    website VARCHAR(255),
    social_profiles JSONB,
    lead_source VARCHAR(100),
    qualification_score INTEGER,
    consent_given BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    consent_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    status ENUM('new', 'qualified', 'contacted', 'interested', 'declined', 'enrolled'),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Outreach Campaign

## Key Features

### Intelligent Lead Scoring
```python
def calculate_lead_score(prospect):
    score = 0
    
    # Website authority
    if prospect.website_da > 30:
        score += 20
    
    # Social media following
    if prospect.total_followers > 10000:
        score += 25
    
    # Content creation frequency
    if prospect.posts_per_week > 3:
        score += 15
    
    # Engagement rate
    if prospect.engagement_rate > 0.03:
        score += 20
    
    # Niche relevance
    if prospect.niche_match_score > 0.7:
        score += 20
    
    return min(score, 100)
```

### Personalization Engine
```python
def generate_personalized_message(template, prospect):
    context = {
        'first_name': prospect.first_name,
        'company': prospect.company,
        'recent_content': get_recent_content(prospect),
        'mutual_connections': find_mutual_connections(prospect),
        'industry_trends': get_industry_trends(prospect.niche)
    }
    
    return template.render(context)
```

- Regular backups and testing
- Performance monitoring and alerts

### Compliance Risks
- Legal review of all communications
- Regular compliance audits
- Staff training on data protection
